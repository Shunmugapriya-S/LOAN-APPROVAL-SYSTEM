## LOAN APPROVAL PREDICTION

## 1. Data Import
The system begins by gathering historical loan application data, typically from CSV files or databases. This dataset includes demographic and financial attributes—such as income, loan amount, credit history—and a target label indicating if the loan was approved or rejected 
## 2. Data Cleaning
Missing values are identified and handled—either by dropping rows or imputing using strategies like mean, median, or mode 
Duplicates are removed and inconsistent entries (e.g., typos in categorical data) are corrected .
Outlier detection, for instance via Z‑scores or IQR, is performed to remove extreme values in critical fields like income 
## 3. Preprocessing & Feature Extraction
Categorical encoding: Convert factors like gender or education into numerical form using techniques like one‑hot or label encoding 
Scaling/Normalization: Continuous features (e.g., income amounts) are standardized or normalized—especially important for algorithms like SVC

.Feature extraction/engineering: Create additional variables such as loan-to-income ratio, debt-to-income ratio, or apply log transformations to reduce skewness 
Feature selection: Use methods like RFE or filter-based selection to keep the most predictive features and eliminate redundant ones 
## .4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Distribution analysis: Review histograms and boxplots for each feature to understand distributions and detect anomalies.
Correlation analysis: Evaluate relationships between features and the target variable, using heatmaps or correlation matrices .
Visualization: Examine categorical trends (e.g., approval rates across property area or credit history) using bar plots and cross-tabul
## 5. Model Training
Logistic Regression: Trains a linear model for binary approval prediction. Strengths include interpretability and probabilistic output.

Support Vector Classifier (SVC): Utilizes margin optimization and kernel functions to handle non-linear relationships. Requires feature scaling and tuning of parameters like C and gamma .

Random Forest: Builds multiple decision trees using bagging and random feature subsets, which reduces overfitting and enhances performance. It also provides insights via feature importance .

Models are trained on a split dataset (commonly 80% train, 20% test) to evaluate generalization.

## 6. Model Validation & Evaluation
Metrics: Evaluate models using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC‑ROC.
Cross‑validation: Apply K‑fold cross‑validation or grid search to tune hyperparameters and ensure model stability 
Comparison: Compare performance across models. Many studies show Random Forest often ranks highest  followed closely by SVC , with Logistic Regression slightly lower  

## 7. Final Model Selection
The choice depends on the balance between:
Accuracy and robustness (Random Forest often excels)
Interpretability (Logistic Regression is the simplest to interpret)
Resource needs (SVC may require more computation than Logistic Regression).
